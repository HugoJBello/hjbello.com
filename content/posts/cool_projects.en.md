There are some interesting projects that want to list here because I had a lot of fun doing them:
- I am working with the [Universal Health Chain](http://www.universal-chain.com/) Team. We are building an universal identifier for health care and donations using blockchain technology.
- I worked for the open source project [Driver UE](https://www.driver-project.eu/). 
This is an emergency notification system based on Apache Kafka. In particular I worked in the [Python adapter](https://github.com/DRIVER-EU/python-test-bed-adapter). I completed this work during my time at GMV.
- Some moths ago I worked in the open source project [Peluditos OWS](https://github.com/OSW-Peludos/peluditos-project). This project tries to build a website to localize, link and analyze lost animals. The technological stack is nodejs, mongodb and react.
- I am the author of the javascript library [string-to-hex-code-color](https://github.com/HugoJBello/string-to-hex-code-color). Which uses hash functions to associate colors to strings of text.
- I have been working for a while in using web scraping to extract real state data from the main real state webs in Spain.
- Using Golang and Nodejs I was able to subtract 10 years worth of news from the main Spanish newspapers. Check the repo [here](https://github.com/news-scrapers). This is part of an ongoing unpublished work about suicide and news.
